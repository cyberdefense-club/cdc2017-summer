For this week's meeting, I want you to do some of the exercises that are 
available at http://learnpython.org. You are welcome to do any of the exercises, 
and ask me questions about any of them, but I want you to specifically 
do the following. It might be a lot for some of you to do in 2 days, but 
see how far you can get.

- Lists
- String Formatting
- Basic String Operations
- Loops
- Conditions 
- Functions

Each of these sections has its own set of examples you can play with and 
an exercise at the end. 

NOTE:
=====
Be advised that some of the example "code" can't actually be run. For example, 
in the Conditions section, the "code" after the words "here is an example for 
using Python's 'if' statement using code blocks" is just pseudo-code. They 
shouldn't have put it in the code editor, because you can't run it. Don't 
let that trick you into thinking you're doing something wrong! :-)

See you Tuesday,
Chris
